# Job Salary Analysis 
This project will analysis the data in different tech fields and try to compare them.
I personally wanted to see what is the difference between remote jobs and in person jobs and how that affects salary.
I also wanted to see if there are any big differences in salaries arcoss countries as well.

## Why Did I Choose This Dataset?
This database was interesting to me because I am a senior that is about to graduate and I would like to know what fields you can work for and how much they pay for as well as the type of level you need to be in order to get these jobs.
